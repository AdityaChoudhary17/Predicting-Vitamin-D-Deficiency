**Project Title:** Predicting Vitamin ‚ÄòD‚Äô Deficiency      
**Tagline:** A custom-built neural network using Python and Scikit-Learn for classification tasks.

**üìñ** **Description**
=====================================================

Welcome to the Neural Network for Classification project! This project is designed to demonstrate the implementation of a custom neural network using Python and Scikit-Learn for classification tasks. The project is structured to be modular, allowing for easy modification and extension of the neural network architecture.

The project is built around two main files: `app.py` and `CustomNeuralNetwork.py`. The `app.py` file is responsible for setting up the Streamlit web application, while the `CustomNeuralNetwork.py` file contains the custom neural network class. The project also includes several dependencies, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.

**‚ú®** **Features**
=====================================================

1. **Custom Neural Network Class**: The project includes a custom neural network class, `CustomNeuralNetwork`, which can be initialized with user-defined input, hidden, and output sizes. The class includes methods for training, testing, and making predictions.
2. **Streamlit Web Application**: The project includes a Streamlit web application, which allows users to interact with the neural network through a user-friendly interface.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: The project includes data preprocessing functions, such as standardization and one-hot encoding, to prepare data for training and testing.
4. **Classification Metrics**: The project includes functions for calculating classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Confusion Matrix**: The project includes a function for generating a confusion matrix, which provides a visual representation of the neural network's performance.
6. **Support for Custom Data**: The project allows users to input their own custom data, making it easy to adapt the neural network to different classification tasks.
7. **Modular Architecture**: The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy modification and extension of the neural network architecture.
8. **Easy Deployment**: The project includes a Streamlit web application, making it easy to deploy the neural network to the cloud or share it with others.
